Shortest-Positioning-(w/Cache)-Time-First (described in

This specifies the level of detail of physical data layout information

0~indicates that the only information available to the scheduler are
the logical block numbers specified in the individual requests.
1~indicates that the scheduler has access to information about zone
boundaries, the number of physical sectors/zone, and the number of
physical sectors/track in each zone.
2~indicates that the scheduler also has access to the layout of spare
sectors or tracks in each zone.
3~indicates that the scheduler also has access to the list of any
slipped sectors/tracks.
4~indicates that the scheduler also has access to the list of any
remapped sectors/tracks, thereby providing an exact data layout
(logical-to-physical mapping) for the disk.
5~indicates that the scheduler uses the cylinder number given to it
with the request, allowing experiments with arbitrary mappings. In
particular, some traces include the cylinder number as part of the
request record.
6~indicates that the scheduler only has access to (an approximation
of) the mean number of sectors per cylinder. The value used in this
case is that specified in the disk parameter ``Avg. sectors per
cylinder.''

The integer value is interpreted as a boolean bitfield. It specifies

concatenated by the scheduler.

scheduled together.
Bit~3 indicates whether or not sequential write requests are always

This specifies the scheduler's policy for dealing with overlapping

0~indicates that overlapping requests are treated as independent.
1~indicates that requests that are completely overlapped by a
completed request that arrived after them are subsumed by that
request.
2~augments this policy by also allowing read requests that arrive
after the completed overlapping request to be subsumed by it, since
the necessary data are known. This support was included for
experiments in \cite{Ganger95} in order to partially demonstrate the
correctness problems of open workloads (e.g.,~feedback-free request
traces). In most real systems, overlapping requests are almost never
concurrently outstanding.

2~indicates that requests in the base queue whose queueing
delays exceed half of the specified timeout value (see below) will be moved to
the next higher priority queue (the timeout queue). Furthermore, such
requests will be moved to the highest priority queue (the priority queue)
